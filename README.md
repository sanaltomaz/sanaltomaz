# Hi, I'm Sanal 👋

I'm a backend-focused developer currently deepening my knowledge in **Java and Spring Boot**, with a strong interest in **software architecture, clean code, and domain modeling**.

I’m not chasing buzzwords.  
I’m focused on understanding how systems are structured, how responsibilities are divided, and how code evolves over time.

Right now, my main goal is to build **solid backend projects**, applying best practices step by step while progressing through structured courses and personal refactorings.

---

## 🧠 Current Focus

- Backend development with **Java & Spring Boot**
- Clean architecture and layered design
- Integration with external APIs
- Data modeling and persistence with **JPA**
- Writing code that is readable, maintainable, and intentional

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (in practice)

**Languages**
- Java
- JavaScript (basic backend usage)

**Backend & Frameworks**
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- Maven

**Databases**
- PostgreSQL (learning & practice)

**Tools**
- Git & GitHub
- VS Code IDEA
- Linux environment

## 🌱 Learning Philosophy

I believe that:
- Understanding *why* matters more than copying *how*
- Refactoring is part of learning, not a failure
- Simple code with clear responsibilities beats clever code

Most of my repositories represent **learning in progress**, with visible evolution and refactors.

## 📌 Notes

This profile reflects my **current stage**, not a final destination.  
Expect repositories to evolve as I progress through backend, persistence, and API design topics.
